This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has fully mounted.  This frequently happens when attempting to use data fetched in `componentDidMount` within the component's render method.  React Native will initially render the component with undefined state, leading to errors if you try to use that state immediately.  For instance:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    // Error: this.state.data might be null at this point!
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
